# Network Packet Sniffer

## Introduction
The Network Packet Sniffer project aims to develop software for monitoring and analyzing network traffic in real-time. It provides tools for capturing, decoding, and analyzing data packets transmitted over a network. The system models network connection behavior using genetic algorithms and identifies network anomalies to enhance security.

### Purpose
The main objective of this system is to model real-time network connection behavior as chromosomes and define genetic algorithm parameters accordingly. By doing so, the system aims to create new rules dynamically during runtime to prevent intruders from attacking the system with viruses.

## Scope of the Project
The project focuses on modeling network connection information as chromosomes and creating new rules during runtime to enhance security. It utilizes genetic algorithms to consider both temporal and spatial information of network connections, making it more effective in identifying network anomalous behaviors.

## About the Project
The Network Packet Sniffer project aims to develop a software tool for monitoring all network traffic, capturing each packet, decoding its content, and analyzing data streams. The project consists of three modules: User Interface, Statistics, and Packet Analysis. The system provides real-time packet capturing, 24x7 network monitoring, advanced protocol analysis, and automatic expert diagnosing.

## Existing System
In the existing system, administrators rely on built-in analyzers or antivirus software for real-time network security. However, these systems may provide limited reports, making it challenging to trace all network problems. The Conversations tab allows monitoring network traffic by each conversation but may not be sufficient for comprehensive analysis.

### Drawbacks with the Existing System
- Requires significant effort to identify traffic issues.
- Time-consuming process.
- Lacks automatic network control.
- Administrator presence is compulsory.

## Proposed System
The proposed system serves as a network analyzer (packet sniffer), allowing easy monitoring and analysis of network traffic. It provides intuitive tab views for monitoring traffic, including Summary, Endpoints, and Protocols views. The system enhances network monitoring, bottleneck detection, and abnormality detection.

### Advantages with the Proposed System
- Enables remote monitoring of packets.
- Provides traffic control capabilities.
- Improves system performance.
- Generates reports on demand.
- Offers graphical data for network analysis.

## Software Requirements
- Language/Package: Java (Swing)
- JDK Version: JDK 1.6.0
